game where the player is a rock star jumping from platform to platform
the rock star's guitar is shaped like a heart
the player may jump by shooting themselves like shooting the bazooka in worms armageddon
charing up the jump to jump further costs heart points, so you must grab points while flying to stay active
the goal of the game is to reach the end of the level flag
failure is when you run out of heart power or fall to the bottom of the screen
sweet guitar riffs play in loop when you are falling down from a jump
the screen bumps like a heart when you jump
the player is able to ground pound in mid jump to save themselves
